       <p>I am a fourteen year old boy who has a lot of interest in computers.I like playing football and basketball. I am a jovial person, I like to see and learn new things at different places. </p>
       I have learnt about many tags and four of them have been listed below.<br>
       a. Underline. e.g I have learnt a lot from <u>text books</u>.<br/>
       b. Bold. e.g I have a <b>Great Dane</b> called Jackson.<br/>
       c. Italics. e.g I have not read even <i>a single book</i> this morning.<br/>
